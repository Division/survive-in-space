**Space shooter game prototype.**

C++ multiplatform engine (only `iOS` wrappers awailable at the moment)
- Custom static mesh format (multiple UV maps supported)
- Compressed PVR texture support.
- Rendering is done by collecting render operations and sorting them by material to minimize shader switches.

**External dependencies:**

- [GLM](http://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.7/index.html) used as the math library
- Integrated [Bullet Physics](http://bulletphysics.org/wordpress/) engine
